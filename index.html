    Most web browsers come equipped with a set of developer tools that allow developers to inspect 
    their HTML, CSS and Javascript code. Also, to trace http request to the web server, investigate performance 
    issues and review web page security. Let's find out more by exploring the homepage of the Little Lemon Cafe. 
    To begin, I've just opened the Little Lemon Cafes web page on my chrome browser. On the homepage, I can view their menu. 
    But I want to explore the HTML structure of this menu. To do that, I need to open the developer tools. To open the developer
     tools in chrome, press the F12 key on your keyboard for PC or command option J on Mac. Alternatively, you can right click on the
      web page and select inspect. There are various tabs on the top row of developer tools that provide different functionality.
       In this video, I'll give you a high level explanation of some of the most used tools. 1st, let's open the console tab. This 
       tab outputs, javascript logs and errors from your web application. The sources tab shows all content resolved for the current page.
        It includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, images and videos. With the network tab, you can inspect the timeline and details of http 
        requests and responses for the web page. The performance tab shows what the web browser is doing over time. It is useful if your 
        web application is running slow because you can pinpoint the functions that are taking the most time. The memory tab displays 
        the parts of your code that are consuming the most resources. Finally, let's check the most used tab the elements tab. You can
         use this tab to inspect the documents, HTML elements and their properties. For example, when I hover over an element in the
          elements tab, it highlights that element in the browser pane. On the right side of the panel, there are tabs for inspecting 
          the details of the elements further. This panel shows us what CSS is applied to an element and the result of the element 
          displayed in the browser. We will explore these details in a later lesson. For now, you just need to know that if you click 
          on an HTML element, then the information for that element will appear in the tab. Now, I'm going to demonstrate a fun trick.
           If you double click the HTML, you can edit it in the web browser. For example, if I select the Our Menu body element,
            then I can change the first item in the menu from chicken Burger, to Turkey Burger.

This doesn't change the content on the web server. It only updates it for me while the web pages open. 
If I open the web page again, it will reset.

The Web browser developer tools are a valuable part of your development
 toolkit to help you investigate and diagnose problems and you now know how to access and make use of them. Great work. -->


 <!--   Frameworks and libraries -->
    <!-- As such it's important for you to know that to speed up development, developers use already developed frameworks and libraries in their application development. 
    These might be open source, meaning that the source code is freely-available for anyone to modify and build from. There are thousands 
    of open source libraries and frameworks available or there might be proprietary, ones that are licensed or developed internally.
     Many developers use the terms framework and library interchangeably, so what's the difference between them? Libraries are reusable 
     pieces of code that can be used by your application. They are purpose-built to provide a specific functionality. To give a more
      technical example, you're building a small e-commerce website. When a user wants to register they need to provide their email address
      . Email addresses while easy to read can be complicated to validate. In fact email addresses are defined across several technical 
      specifications. That's a lot of reading just to validate an email. Even if you do read through all the specification, there's no point
       in spending hours or even days implementing their standards because you have access to so many readily-available libraries to validate
        email addresses. It is for specific functionality like validating an email address that libraries are useful. A developers simply 
        uses the library to access the functionality they require, as a result they can have more time to continue focusing on the 
        development of their application. Frameworks on the other hand provide a structure for developers to build with. Consider
         this in the context of our carpenter analogy. As a carpenter you create a lot of different chairs, therefore there would be 
         a blueprint for each chair to speed up building them. You can decide the type of wood to use, but the dimensions and style of
          the chair are always the same. Frameworks act as a structure where the developer provides their own code that the framework
           interacts with. For example, there are many frameworks for developing web applications. These frameworks handle functionality
            that is common to all web applications such as receiving HTTP requests and sending HTTP responses. The developer then adds
             their own code that implements the functionality of the web application. For instance with the e-commerce website example, 
             a framework would handle receiving HTTP requests. The developer would implement code that processes the request and returns
              a response from which the framework would send a response over HTTP. Now let's compare how the frameworks relate to libraries.
               Most frameworks use many libraries. The libraries that the framework uses can be used for your application. If you wish, 
               your application can also use other libraries. You also need to consider when to use a framework and when to use a library. 
            Frameworks are considered opinionated and libraries are considered unopinionated. This is defined as the degree of freedom 
            available to the developer to choose how to code a feature. The opinionatedness will vary between frameworks, but by definition 
            they will always be more opinionated than a library. The benefit of this is that they can replace libraries as needed. For 
            example when new technologies become available frameworks to find the libraries flow and control of an application, whereas 
            with the libraries those are left to the developer to decide. As with everything there are advantages and disadvantages to both.
            Frameworks are a great way to reduce development time and to enforce a structure on how code is written. They have many best 
            practices already in place and contain most of what is needed to develop an application, however, sometimes you may find that
             the way you need to code something doesn't fit into the structure of the framework. Other times you may find that some of the 
             libraries the framework uses may conflict with a library that you are required to use and cause compatibility issues. If an
              application is built without a framework, the developer will need to decide on the set of libraries they wish to use to 
              achieve the functionality they must deliver. They will also need to take care that the selected libraries can work together.
               The upside to this is that they can replace libraries as needed. For example, if a new better library is released, the 
               developer can replace the usage of the old library. This is much easier than replacing a framework. Frameworks and libraries
                give you the opportunity to reuse existing web app functions. This can result in faster development, fewer errors, and more 
                time for you to spend on the essential features of your application. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you can use frameworks
                 and libraries that are designed specifically to help your web app development processes. -->


                 <!-- APIs and services -->
                  <!-- Every day you access information on your phone, like reading the news, purchasing goods and services
                   or communicating with friends over social media. But how is all this information transferred behind the scenes?
                    Your favorite websites and apps. Probably use API's and as a web developer, you'll discover that API's developer
                     friendly, easily accessible and a very valuable and useful development tool. A PI is the acronym for application
                      programming interface. An API is a set of functions and procedures for creating applications that access the features 
                      or data of an operating system, application or other service. If this still sounds a bit vague, just remember that 
                      the term API, is intentionally open too many applications and use cases. As a web developer, a lot of the day to day 
                      job involves working with API's. Some common API's that web developers work with include Browser, API REST API and
                       Sensor-Based API. Over the next few minutes, you'll explore each of these API types and review a few specific 
                       examples. To begin with, here's a brief outline of how a piecewise functions. In Software development, API's are 
                       often the bridge between different components or systems. This earns them names like gateway or middleware. 
                       The term is used widely to represent many different tools and systems. Let's consider some examples of different 
                       API use cases. One common type of API, is Browser or Web APIs, which are built into the browser itself.
                        They extend the functionality of the browser by adding new services and are designed to simplify complex
                         functions and provide easy syntax for building advanced features. A good example, is the DOM API. The DOM API
                          turns the html document into a tree of nodes that are represented as JavaScript objects. Another example, is 
                          the geolocation API that returns coordinates of where the browser is located. There are also other API's available 
                          for fetching data known as Fetch API drawing, graphics or Canvas API keeping history or history API. And client 
                          side storage also known as Web Storage API. Another critical type of API for web development is the RESTful or
                           REST API. This kind of API provides data for popular web and mobile apps. These are also called web servers. 
                           Let's explore REST in a bit more detail. REST or representational state transfer, is a set of principles that 
                           help build highly efficient API's. One of the main responsibilities of these kinds of API's is sending and 
                           receiving data to and from a centralized database. We can query our own REST API or third party ones. One 
                           last type of API, that you might encounter as a web developer is a Sensor-Based API. This is what the internet
                            of things also known as IOT is based on. These are actual physical senses that are interconnected with each
                             other. The sensors can communicate through API and track and respond to physical data. Some examples are 
                             Philips hue, smart lights and node bots. That's a lot of API to think about. Fortunately, for web developers
                              the most common data API is a RESTtful API which as you've learned is a web server that provides responses 
                              to requests. These API web servers are designed to provide the data backbone for a web client like a web page 
                              or mobile app. This means that these API's must be able to accomplish things like getting data or get, 
                              creating data. Also referred to as post updating data or put and deleting data or delete. API issues, REST 
                              principles and good design practices to create discoverable interfaces. This helps us get the exact response
                               expected. But exactly how do they work? Here's a closer description of their activity. These API's use 
                               endpoints to specify how different resources can be accessed. The endpoint is built into the URL when 
                               accessing the API. Once the endpoint is hit, the API performs whatever service side processing is needed 
                               to build the response. Two common forms of response are, full web pages and data form based on JavaScript 
                               called Jason. In this video, you explored some API's and as a web developer, you will frequently work 
                               with many different types of API's. You will often use API's to extend the abilities of systems or to act
                                as a bridge between different components. -->

                  
                                <!-- What is a an IDE? -->

<!-- Think of a group of construction workers, every worker has a toolbox that helps them get their job done. As a developer, 
you'll also use many tools. One of the main tools in your toolbox is the integrated development environment or IDE. 
By the end of this video you'll be able to identify an IDE and explain the benefits of using an IDE during development.
 An integrated development environment or IDE is software for building applications. An IDE is just like a text editor 
 except instead of writing documents you're writing code. There are many IDEs available, some are specific to one programming
  language while others support many languages in one IDE. Let's explore some common IDE features. Here I am working within an IDE.
   First let's cover syntax highlighting. To improve readability for developers, IEDs have syntax highlighting. What this means,
    is that special keywords of the programming language are highlighted in different colors so that the developer can quickly
     differentiate these keywords from other texts. For example, if you're writing JavaScript code without syntax highlighting, 
     it could be harder to identify keywords from other texts. With syntax highlighting, that gets much easier because the JavaScript
      keywords and variables are colored differently. Now, let's explore error highlighting. Just like checking spelling in a text document, 
      IDEs can highlight mistakes you make in your programming code. For example, if I delete the equal symbol where it's needed,
       my IDE will highlight the error. Another feature of IDEs is also complete. When you're typing a message on your phone, 
       it suggests words as you type. An IDE's autocomplete is a similar feature. Since programming languages have special keywords, 
       IDEs can offer suggestions to autocomplete words as you start typing them. Additionally, another feature called IntelliSense 
       can make IEDs very smart and even able to understand your code. They can detect variables and functions and offer them as 
       suggestions during autocomplete. For example, if I have a JavaScript function named myFunction defined at the top of the 
       JavaScript file, then as soon as I start typing the letter m my IDE suggest this function as an autocompletion. Then there 
       is refactoring. Since IEDs understand your code, they can help you if you need to change it. To demonstrate how refactoring 
       works, let's continue with the myFunction function that I defined a moment ago. In the code, the function is then called 
       multiple times. It can also be called in the code of other files too. But what if you need to rename this function? 
       You would need to rename it in every file that uses the function ensuring that you update those files to use the new name. 
       This process is known as refactoring, changing the structure of the code without changing the functionality. Doing 
       this manually is very time consuming and prone to error. If you mistyped the new function name in one place,
        the application will break. Since the IDE understand your code, it can assist with refactoring and automatically
         update the function name across all files. 
         That saves a lot of time. Let's rename our function now. I just right 
         click on the function and select rename symbol.
          Then I change it from myFunction to ourFunction. The IED then updates 
         all references of that function name. IDEs come with a lot of other features to help investigate bugs and collaborate with other
          developers. Many even allow you to extend their functionality using plugins and extensions, but that's beyond the scope of this
           lesson. We have explored some features of IDEs in this video. You now know how IDEs operate as part of the developers toolbox 
           to write code more effectively.  -->

<!-- Module Summary - Get started with Web Development -->
<!-- 
You've reached the end of this module on web development. Over the course of this module, you've explored the basics 
of how the web works and familiarize yourself with key concepts in core internet technologies. Let's recap the key 
skills that you gained along the way. You started the module with an overview of how the web works and explored the basics of web pages, 
web servers and web browsers. In terms of web pages, you should now be able to, differentiate between a website and a web page by outlining
 the key elements of each. Outline the purpose of html and CSS and provide an explanation of how they work. And identify the benefits 
 that Javascript provides to a web page like interactivity and data processing. You've also explored the basics of web servers, and 
 should be able to explain how a data center provides storage and power for web servers. Differentiate between the key functions of web 
 server hardware and software and outline how a web server handles requests through HTTP or hypertext transfer protocol. And you explored 
 the third key technology of the web, which is web browsers. Following this exploration, you should now be able to, explain what a web 
 browser is, describe how a web browser receives content from a web server and displays it for users and outline the request response cycle. 
 After your study of how the web works, you investigated core internet technologies. You should now be able to explain the concept of IP 
 addresses and how they facilitate the transfer of data across the internet, demonstrate an understanding of how HTTP functions and identify 
 common HTTP methods and outline how HTMl, CSS and Javascript interact with one another. To generate web pages, differentiate between a web
  page, website and web app, identify the front end and back end of a web app and list common web browser developer tools. And finally, you 
  should be able to demonstrate an understanding of libraries and frameworks along with their advantages and disadvantages, identify an 
  application programming interface or API and explain how its utilized in application development and explained the purpose and benefits
  of an IDE or integrated development environment. Now that you have completed this module, you should be able to demonstrate your knowledge
   of the basic concepts of how the web works. And you've also demonstrated your understanding
 of core Internet technologies. You've made a great start on your learning journey. Excellent work. -->
